BCDEdit is a command-line tool for managing Boot Configuration Data (BCD).

BCD files provide a store that is used to describe boot applications and boot application settings.

BCDEdit can be used for a variety of purposes, including creating new stores, modifying existing stores, adding boot menu options, and so on.

You'll need administrative privileges to use BCDEdit to modify BCD. Start the Command Prompt (Admin) or use Windows PE.

A normal shutdown and reboot is necessary to ensure that any modified BCDEdit settings are flushed to disk.

BCDEdit is included in the %WINDIR%\System32 folder.

BCDEdit is limited to the standard data types and is designed primarily to perform single common changes to BCD. Related resources:

Some common BCD operations, such as recovering a partition or setting up a new PC's system partition, may be more easily accomplished by using BCDboot.
For complex operations or nonstandard data types, consider using the BCD Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) application programming interface (API) to create more powerful and flexible custom tools.
BCDEdit Command-Line Options
The following command-line options are available for BCDEdit.exe.

BCDEdit /Command[Argument1] [Argument2] ...

Help
HELP
Option	Description
/? [commmand]	
Displays a list of BCDEdit commands.

To display detailed help for a particular command, run bcdedit /?command, where command is the name of the command you are searching for more information about.


Copy
bcdedit /? createstore
Operating on a store
OPERATING ON A STORE
Option	Description
/createstore	Creates a new empty boot configuration data store. The created store is not a system store.
/export	Exports the contents of the system store into a file. This file can be used later to restore the state of the system store. This command is valid only for the system store.
/import	Restores the state of the system store by using a backup data file previously generated by using the /export option. This command deletes any existing entries in the system store before the import takes place. This command is valid only for the system store.
/store	This option can be used with most BCDedit commands to specify the store to be used. If this option is not specified, then BCDEdit operates on the system store. Running the bcdedit /store command by itself is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active command.
/sysstore	Sets the system store device. This only affects EFI-based systems. It does not persist across reboots, and is only used in cases where the system store device is ambiguous.
Operating on entries in a store
OPERATING ON ENTRIES IN A STORE
Option	Description
/copy	Makes a copy of a specified boot entry in the same system store.
/create	Creates a new entry in the boot configuration data store. If a well-known identifier is specified, then the /application, /inherit, and /device options cannot be specified. If an identifier is not specified or not well known, an /application, /inherit, or /device option must be specified.
/delete	Deletes an element from a specified entry.
/mirror	Creates mirror of entries in the store.
Changing entry options
CHANGING ENTRY OPTIONS
Option	Description
/deletevalue	Deletes a specified element from a boot entry.
/set	Sets an entry option value.
For example, this command will enable the system to trust Windows Insider Preview builds that are signed with certificates that are not trusted by default:


Copy
Bcdedit /set {bootmgr} flightsigning on
Bcdedit /set flightsigning on
Reboot after running the command. To turn off flightsigning:


Copy
Bcdedit /set {bootmgr} flightsigning off
Bcdedit /set flightsigning off
Controlling output
CONTROLLING OUTPUT
Option	Description
/enum	Lists entries in a store. The /enum option is the default value for BCEdit, so running the bcdedit command without options is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active command.
/v	Verbose mode. Usually, any well-known entry identifiers are represented by their friendly shorthand form. Specifying /v as a command-line option displays all identifiers in full.
Running the bcdedit /v command by itself is equivalent to running the bcdedit /enum active /v command.

Controlling the boot manager
CONTROLLING THE BOOT MANAGER
Option	Description
/bootsequence	Specifies a one-time display order to be used for the next boot. This command is similar to the /displayorder option, except that it is used only the next time the computer starts. Afterwards, the computer reverts to the original display order.
/default	Specifies the default entry that the boot manager selects when the timeout expires.
/displayorder	Specifies the display order that the boot manager uses when displaying boot options to a user.
/timeout	Specifies the time to wait, in seconds, before the boot manager selects the default entry.
/toolsdisplayorder	Specifies the display order for the boot manager to use when displaying the Tools menu.
Emergency Management Services options
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SERVICES OPTIONS
Option	Description
/bootems	Enables or disables Emergency Management Services (EMS) for the specified entry.
/ems	Enables or disables EMS for the specified operating system boot entry.
/emssettings	Sets the global EMS settings for the computer. /emssettings does not enable or disable EMS for any particular boot entry.
Debugging
DEBUGGING
Option	Description
/bootdebug	Enables or disables the boot debugger for a specified boot entry. Although this command works for any boot entry, it is effective only for boot applications.
/dbgsettings	Specifies or displays the global debugger settings for the system. This command does not enable or disable the kernel debugger; use the /debug option for that purpose. To set an individual global debugger setting, use the bcdedit /setdbgsettings type value command.
/debug	Enables or disables the kernel debugger for a specified boot entry.
/hypervisorsettings	Sets the hypervisor parameters.
To troubleshoot a new installation, enable debug mode by modifying the boot configuration file (BCD). For example, use the following syntax to enable kernel or boot debug.


Copy
bcdedit /set <id> debug on
-or-


Copy
bcdedit /set <id> bootdebug on
where <id> is the GUID of the Loader object that is used to load the operating system. "Default" can be used if the operating system is the default option of the Boot Manager menu.

For examples of BCDEdit, see Boot Configuration Data in Windows Vista.

Remote event logging
REMOTE EVENT LOGGING
Option	Description
/eventsettings	Sets the global remote event logging parameters.
/event	Enables or disables remote event logging for an operating system entry.
